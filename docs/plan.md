# Outdoor Risk — Build Blueprint (MVP)

This blueprint translates **spec.md** into a concrete, test-driven, incremental plan you can execute during the hackathon. It breaks work into phases → chunks → bite-size steps, and includes ready-to-use **LLM coding prompts** (TDD-first) with no orphan code.

> Primary references (kept in this plan for dev context):
> • NASA POWER Hourly API & parameters • IMERG V07 Final Run (half-hourly mm/hr) • Harmony (subset/regrid) • NWS Heat Index & Wind Chill formulas • Python `zoneinfo` & `timezonefinder` • Clopper–Pearson method. See **spec.md** citations list.
